- Ad Boosts Utilization: With only 43.29% of products using ad boosts and only 30% of products using urgency banner it is advised to implement these tools for larger number of products. Prioritize ad boosts for products with high margin but low visibility to improve their sales performance. 
- Merchant Performance: Merchants with lower average ratings correlate with lower sales. Offer support and training for merchants to improve product quality and customer service.
- Price Optimization: Products priced between 8-12€ show a higher units sold volume. Review and adjust the prices of underperforming products to fall within this range to boost sales.
- Focus on High-Performance Products: Products with ratings above 4.0 and more than 500 sales dominate the top 10% sales bracket. Increase inventory and marketing focus on high-rating products to leverage their popularity.
